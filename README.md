‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Disclaimer**: WalletGen is a research and educational tool. It is not intended for unauthorized or malicious use. Always use it responsibly and only on wallets you own or have permission to access.

## How It Works

WalletGen generates wallets in accordance with industry standards, using [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), and [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) for Bitcoin, and also uses the [Keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) hashing function for EVM-based chains like Ethereum.

The software works by creating and checking for the validity of potential addresses against public blockchain explorers. WalletGen's high speeds, the result of its C++ foundation, provide a distinct advantage over other tools. The performance is primarily dependent on the capabilities of your CPU and GPU.

## How to Search for Lost Bitcoin & Ethereum Wallets with Balance

**Wallet Gen** utilizes brute-force to check wallet balances.

### Bitcoin (BTC) Wallet Search:

*   Press `3` or run `start_search_btc.bat` to search via the internet. This may take longer, due to real-time checks.
*   Press `6` to search using the database for a faster process.

### EVM Wallet Search (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Press `5` or run `start_search_evm.bat` for an internet search.
*   Press `6` for the faster database search method.

### Speed Considerations:

*   Your hardware, particularly your GPU, impacts speed. Run multiple instances (1 to 4) for better results.

Databases significantly improve efficiency.

## The Program Found a Wallet ‚Äî What‚Äôs Next?

When WalletGen detects a wallet with a balance:
*   It will **Stop** immediately.
*   The wallet details will be **Displayed** in the console.
*   Data is **Saved** in the `found_wallets.txt` file.

### How to Access the Funds?

1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** into a compatible wallet (Metamask, Trust Wallet, or Electrum).
2.  You'll be able to transfer the funds.
